 * A DocHandle is a wrapper around a single Automerge document that lets us listen for changes and

 * @remarks
 * A `DocHandle` represents a document which is being managed by a {@link Repo}. You shouldn't ever
 * instantiate this yourself. To obtain `DocHandle` use {@link Repo.find} or {@link Repo.create}.
 *
 * To modify the underlying document use either {@link DocHandle.change} or
 * {@link DocHandle.changeAt}. These methods will notify the `Repo` that some change has occured and
 * the `Repo` will save any new changes to the attached {@link StorageAdapter} and send sync
 * messages to connected peers.
